# Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a type of denial of service attack in which the incoming traffic floods the victim's system, making it difficult to respond to legitimate requests.



## Getting Started

To get started with the design, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rasi23/DDoS-attack-using-Python-and-Scapy.git

Operation
To use the design, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the ddos-attack directory:
cd ddos-attack

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the script:
python3 ddos.py

#Enter the IP address of the target website/machine and the port number. You can use nslookup to find the IP address of the target website or use any other online tool.

That's it! The attack will start automatically.#
